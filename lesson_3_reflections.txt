When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

if I have to work together with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may have some changes that you don't want to share with others at a particular point in time. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: for copying files in the github
clones: for committing changes in the local computer
branches: for copying and modifying files in the local computer 

They all serve different functions 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

you can keep it apart from the remote master branch and merge them when it is necessary to do so 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Will have to use dropbox or google drive. they are easier to use in the sense that I don't need to learn the language of git or github but i doubt it may create 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I want to freely experiement with my codes before officially incorporating them into the collaborative work I do with others.
