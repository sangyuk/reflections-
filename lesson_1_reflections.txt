How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I was able to identify differences quickly. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It will enable me to go back to the version i want quickly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: I can control what to save 
Con: I may miss saving certain changes 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they can serve different purposes that way 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log: to view the entire history of commits 
git diff: to view the changes made between commits 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

very confident because I can always go back to the safer commit should anything goes wrong
